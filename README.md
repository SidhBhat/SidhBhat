# Introduction

My name is Siddharth Bhat, But I like Sid better. And Welcome to my Github profile!
Here I publish some random shit that I write as a hobby.

There are a couple of things that really intrigue and exite me, these are computers,
mathematics and physics. Physics for me is just a playground for the latter two. I really
am passionate about these topics. Much of the code I write has some mathematical or physical
implication.

I am formally not trained in code, everything I have learnt was learnt by myself, a lot during the
global pandemic and subsequent lockdowns. I can testify I have some expertise on `C` & `C++`,
octave/matlab, and a bunch of scripting langauges and tools ('bash' and related shells, `awk`,
system administration on linux, and obviously `git`).

I am currently studying undergradute B. Sc (Bachlor of Science), and am based in Banglore.
